      <p>Create Third Places was created by Bharat Ponnaluri to promote accessible offline public spaces. It is
        inspired by the organization <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/">Strong Towns</a>, which empowers
        people to improve towns and neighborhoods through bottom up change. It is also based on the
        ideas of sociologist Ray Oldenberg who coined the term "Third Place". Create Third Places is a non-commercial
        open source entity. </p>
