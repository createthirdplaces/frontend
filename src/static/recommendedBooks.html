    <h2>Here are some books related to promoting third places that I recommend</h2>

    <h3>Books I have read</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <b><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/strong-towns-a-bottom-up-revolution-to-rebuild-american-prosperity-charles-l-marohn/88111ddf5d7adeb0?ean=9781119564812&next=t">
        Strong Towns: A Bottom-up Revolution to Rebuild American Prosperity by Charles Marohn</a></b>
      <div>
         This book
        makes a compelling case for how bottom up driven community improvements are beneficial. On the website for his
        nonprofit <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/">Strong Towns</a>, there are a variety of useful guides
        on how people can create third places.
      </div>

        Marohn worked as a transportation engineer before starting Strong
        Towns, and wrote a book called
        <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/confessions-of-a-recovering-civil-engineer-transportation-for-a-strong-town/9781119699293t">
          Confessions of a Recovering Engineer</a>. As an engineer who is working on software that prioritizes
          improving local communities, I personally relate.

      <li>
        <b><a href="https://noreena.com/book/the-lonely-century/">The Lonely Century</a> by Noreena Hertz:</b>
        <div>I found
       this book to a great resource for explaining how we can improve human connection, which was helpful
        in my attempts to promote third places through hosting events.
