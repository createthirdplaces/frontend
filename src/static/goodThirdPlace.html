  <h1>What makes a third place good</h1>

  <q>Most needed are those 'third places' which lend a public balance to the increased privatization of home life.
    Third places are nothing more than informal public gathering places. The phrase 'third places' derives from
    considering our homes to be the 'first' places in our lives, and our work places the 'second.'</q>(Ray Oldenburg)

  <p>There are a variety of third places that exist. In the book
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Good_Place_(book)">The Great Good Place</a>, Ray Oldenburg
    establishes the following 8 characteristics of a great third place. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>On neutral ground: <q>In order for the city and its neighborhoods to offer the rich and varied association
    that is their promise and their potential, there must be <i>neutral ground</i> upon which people may gather. There
    must be places where individuals may come and go as they please, in which non are required to play host, and in which
    all feel at home and comfortable.</q>(Ray Oldenburg)</li>
    <li>The third place is a leveler:<q>A place that is a leveler is, by nature, an inclusive place. It is accessible to
    the general public and does not set formal criteria of membership and exclusion</q>(Ray Oldenburg)</li>
    <li>Conversation is the main activity</li>
    <li>Accessibility and accommodation</li>
    <li>The regulars</li>
    <li>A low profile:<q>Third places are unimpressive looking for the most part. They are not,
    with few exceptions, advertised; they are not elegant</q>(Ray Oldenburg)</li>
    <li>The mood is playful</li>
    <li>A home away from home</li>
  </ul>
