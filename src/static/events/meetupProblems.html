    <h1>Challenges I had with Meetup.com by Bharat Ponnaluri</h1>

    <p>
      I became a regular user of Meetup.com in 2014, and used the website as a way to find
      board game events and other social events. In 2021, I become an organizer for the Meetup
      group Beer & Board Games and started hosting regular events.
    </p>

    <p>I started noticing a decline in the quality of Meetup.com with the following issues </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slow loading times.</li>
      <li>UI changes making the site harder to navigate.</li>
      <li>Changes to events not being saved correctly.</li>
      <li>Difficulty finding groups and events. I had multiple people directly tell me that
      they had a hard  time finding my events. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These issues weren't getting resolved. At the same time, Meetup started increasing fees and
      putting features behind paywalls. In April 2025, I took over a Meetup group called the Dupont
    Circle Gaming Group, and I ended up closing the group soon after. The cost for maintaining the group
     high, and people were not interested in using the group to host events.</p>
