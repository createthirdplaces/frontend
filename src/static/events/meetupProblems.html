    <h1>Challenges I had with Meetup.com by Bharat Ponnaluri</h1>

    <p>
      I became a regular user of Meetup.com in 2014, and used the website as a way to find
      board game events and other social events. In 2021, I become an organizer for the Meetup
      group Beer & Board Games and started hosting regular events.
    </p>

    <p>I started noticing a decline in the quality of Meetup.com with the following issues.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slow loading times.</li>
      <li>UI changes making the site harder to navigate.</li>
      <li>Changes to events not being saved correctly.</li>
      <li>Difficulty finding groups and events. I had multiple people directly tell me that
      they had a hard time finding my events. </li>
      <li>Excessive monetization. In December 2025, the yearly cost of an organizer subscription to create a
      Meetup group was $300.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These issues weren't getting resolved. At the same time, Meetup started increasing fees and
      putting features behind paywalls. In April 2025, I took over a Meetup group called the Dupont
    Circle Gaming Group, and I ended up closing the group soon after. The cost for maintaining the group
    was too high, and people were not interested in using the group to host events.</p>

    <h2>Examples of issues I found in December 2025</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Page for one of my Sunday board game events</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The load time was 2.80 seconds, 2.08MB of Javascript was transferred, which translated to 8.08 MB of
          uncompressed JavaScript. Meetup.com uses the Next.js framework, which is designed to optimize page
        load time by rendering on the server and minimize the amount of JavaScript content transferred. Unless I edit the event
        details, someone updates an RSVP or posts a comment, the page does not change. I reloaded the page, and the total
        load time was 3.65 seconds with 2.08MB of JavaScript. </li>
        <li>Meetup showed a banner called "Your 2025 recap is out" that took up page space. I had closed the banner multiple
          times and did not want to see the recap Meetup generated. I also had to scroll to see RSVP information, which
          I wanted to see as a host. There was also a banner at the bottom of the page showing the name of the event
         and the event date a second time.</li>
        <li>After scrolling down slightly, I saw the address and "How to find us" message displayed twice. The
        banner at the bottom with redundant duplicate information was still visible and was covering up attendance
        information.</li>
        <li>There is a button called "2025" which opens a popup about my Meetup 2025 recap. It is the same
        popup that opens up if I click on the recap banner. Also, viewing the recap requires downloading an app, when
        it can be displayed on a regular webpage.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary>Searching for board game events near DC </summary>

      <ul>
        <li>The same issues with slow loading speed and excessive JavaScript seen on my event page are also present. The
        banner for my Meetup recap that I don't want to see is also not visible</li>
        <li>Meetup showed a banner asking me to create a group to start organizing events. However, I was already
        organizing events through a group I was go organizer for.</li>
        <li>There is an open to view events by category, including categories that are not relevant for board games.</li>
        <li>When scrolling down, I saw an online event from a group that was advertised as being for people in
        and around NYC. An online event can't be considered to be near DC. Also, the group had its location listed as
        NYC, which is more than 18 miles from DC.</li>
        <li>One of the events was a recurring event for a location that has had no tables and chairs for more than a
          year. The event description mentioned the tables and chairs that were removed, and it also mentioned a
          restaurant that that was  no longer open. I had reported the event to Meetup months ago and no action was
          taken.</li>

      <summary>Viewing Meetup homepage</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The same issues with a slow loading time, excessive JavaScript loading, and unwanted recap banner were visible.</li>
        <li>Meetup showed one group that I was an organizer for. Meetup also showed the text "Become an organizer". </li>
        <li>There were duplicate buttons to try Meetup+ One was at the top and one was in a large banner near the bottom
        of the page.</li>
        <li>A significant amount of space was taken by two
        unnecessary banners and a message saying "Looks like your groups are free on this date -- no events to show". Also,
        the event I was going to host in a few days did not show up. However, an event afterwards was displayed.</li>
        <li>Information is not logically consistent: The events under the "Your events" section and "From groups" you're
          part of were different. The "Top picks for you"  section also showed two events I was going to attend that were
          not visible in other sections.</li>
        <li>The "Top picks for you" section showed an online event that I did not indicate any interest in. One event
        I was going to host and two events I was planning to attend were shown afterwards.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary>Subscription costs</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The cost for an organizer subscription to create a group as $25.00/month or $300.00 per year.</li>
        <li>A subscription to Meetup+ costs $129.99/year. Without Meetup+, attendees to an event who aren't
        organizers will not be able to see the names and pictures of people who are attending. $129.99/year is
        excessive to charge for a feature many people find to be useful. Users can also use an avatar and pseudonym
        if they don't want to show their real name.</li>

      <summary>Generative AI use</summary>
      Generative AI is a fundamentally flawed technology, and it is not useful on Meetup.com
      <ul>
        <li>When editing information for an event I'm hosting, Meetup shows a button that allows users to generate
          an event description using AI. AI doesn't have the context to understand the games me and the people attending
          my event enjoy, and it doesn't know anything about our personalities.</li>
