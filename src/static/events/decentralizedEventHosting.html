      <h1>Decentralized event hosting</h1>

      <p>
        Create Third Places is working on open source software
        for people to find in person events as a way of promoting third places. It will be designed as a decentralized
        open source alternative to Meetup.com.
      </p>

      <h2>Guidelines that will be followed for any changes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Support in person interaction</li>
        <li>All content is human generated</li>
        <li>No personalized recommendations</li>
        <li>No commercial monetization</li>
        <li>Promote decentralization</li>
      </ul>

      <p>See the <a href="/static/vision.html">vision page</a> for more details.</p>

      <h2>Overview of decentralized architecture</h2>

      <h3>The decentralized architecture includes 2 types of websites:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Event websites</b>:Websites for a specific type or activity or area  They will share event and group data through an API. </li>
        <li><b>Aggregator websites</b>: They will read data from local
          websites and allow users to search their data.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Websites can be both aggregator websites and event websites.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>More details about decentralized architecture</summary>
        <p>
          One example would a website for chess events in DC and another website for resource management board
          games such as Catan. An aggregator website could then read information from the chess
          website and Catan website, and allow users to search for events related to both games. The board game
          aggregator website could then have its data read by a DC area aggregator website that combines information
          from other types of websites such as a DC sports event website.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this architecture is decentralized, it might be desirable for an organization to have
          an implementation of this under centralized control. One example would be a local parks agency managing events
          for multiple parks. In this case, decentralization would come from the
          fact that managers of individual parks can have event sites, while sharing the events with an aggregator that
          can be used to search for events across multiple parks.
        </p>

        <p>
          A similar architecture has seen success in settings where centralized control outside of the computer systems is necessary.
          For example The Create Third Places decentralized architecture is similar to the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula_model">Bell-LaPadula security
            model</a> with discretionary access control which was used by the US Department of Defense.</p>

        <p>To summarize, the Create Third Places architecture and any other decentralized architecture has an effective decentralization
          level based on the centralization level of the outside entities controlling the individual parts. Create Third Places,
          blockchain, or any other decentralized architecture is not capable of forcing decentralization on a system
          that an outside entity wants to centralize.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Websites using the decentralized architecture will follow these guidelines</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a group is created on a local website, the information is saved to a database of events for the website
            with a UUID as the primary key. The events would then be accessible through a public API.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggregator websites save the UUIDs of all groups in their aggregation and include references to the API endpoint
            of the original site location. This information would then be available through an API endpoint for other aggregator
            websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            When an aggregator website requests information about a specific group, it will retrieve the UUID and local
            website URL from its database. This information can then be used to perform a query on the local website through multiple
            aggregation layers without significant performance degradation. An aggregator website will also be able to request a list of
            events.
          </li>
          <li>All aggregator websites will need to register with the websites they are aggregating from. After registering,
            the aggregator will retrieve all the groups from the website they registered with. When a group is
            created or deleted, it will look at the websites that registered as aggregators, and then call an API endpoint for
            the aggregator to make sure it has information about the group.
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent loops, each aggregator will have a level specified by an integer ranging from 0 to
            2,147,483,647. A website will not be able to aggregate data from a higher level. Local
            event websites should have a level of 0 to have their data to be read by aggregators. Any website that will not
            support aggregators should have a level of 2,147,483,647.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Challenges that this architecture will address</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Efficiently reading updated data from other websites. If an aggregator website has to check other websites to
            get information and those websites are also aggregators, then it will be important to optimize performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handling authentication and user permissions. One possible way to address the complexity would be for people to
            have the ability to join group or modify groups they created through aggregator websites. This would help with
            usability. However, it would add complexity in the short term and could make things too centralized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handling issues with too many requests from a location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resiliency against being compromised by a single point of failure. If an aggregator website crashes
            or is affected by hackers, a new aggregator website can be created with the data stored on local websites. Also,
            the decentralized architecture means that malicious actors do not have a single target they can focus on. The
            need for aggregators to have permission from local sites to retrieve data means that local sites can also
            decide to cancel permissions to block aggregators.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary>Reasons why a decentralized network of third websites is a good idea</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is difficult for a general purpose website to meet the interests of specific hobbies or communities. People
            have a variety of different interests that will be complex to effectively represent on one website. Also, it is
            impossible for the developers of one site to have knowledge about every single community and hobby.
          </li>
          <li>
            Smaller websites can have content related to the interests of their audience without affecting how others
            see content they are interested in. As an example, <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com">dmvboardgames.com</a>,
            a website promoting in person board games in the DC area has a <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/html/static/designers.html">
            page for local board game designers.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Local community organizers can submit event information to a large aggregator website without being
            dependent on them. If the large website does something similar to Meetup.com and starts charging $300 per year
            to host groups while downgrading their UI, the owners can move to a different aggregator or not use one.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ability to connect with <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> websites through
            <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/">ActivityPub.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            It is easier for individual communities to move to an alternative. If the quality of an aggregator website
            declines, users can switch to an alternative aggregator site without losing group and event data that is on
            a local website. Local websites owners can also remove access to an aggregator if they think that aggregator
            should no longer be used.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <p>
        A local website for in person board games in the DC area is
        being worked on at <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/">dmvboardgames.com</a>.
        Other third place websites will be able to read data from the dmvboardgames.com
        backend through an API. Source code for dmvboardgames.com is
        <a href="https://github.com/gatherspiel/DMVBoardGames">here</a>.

      <h2>Issues with other websites used to promote third places</h2>
      <p>
        In the past, there were a variety of websites that people could use to promote events in third
        places. Unfortunately many of them have declined in quality or started to prioritize keeping people online.
        The website Meetup.com was a notable exception as it prioritized in person events. However,
        the quality of Meetup has declined, and it is no longer a good option for hosting events.
        <a href="/static/events/meetupProblems.html">See this page for more details.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Other platforms are attempting to compete with Meetup such as Luma and Partiful. However, they follow
        the same VC funded for profit business model used by Meetup, and are on the path to
        <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys">enshittification</a>.
        This includes one former competitor Eventbrite, which has been
        <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/bending-spoons-agrees-to-buy-eventbrite-for-500m-to-revive-stalled-brand/">
          purchased by the company Bending Spoons</a>. This is the same company that owns Meetup.com and has been responsible
        for its latest problems.
