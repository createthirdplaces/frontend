  <h1>Decentralized meetup alternative</h1>

  <p>
    Createthirdplaces.com is  working on open source software
    for people to find in person events as a way of promoting third places.
  </p>

  Here are the guidelines that will be followed for any changes
  See the <a href="/static/vision.html">vision page </a> for more details.

  <ul>
    <li>Support in person interaction</li>
    <li>All content is human generated</li>
    <li>No personalized recommendations</li>
    <li>Non-commercial</li>
    <li>Decentralization</li>
  </ul>


  <br>
  <p>
    As a starting point, a local website for in person board games in the DC area
    has been created at <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/">dmvboardgames.com</a>.
    Other third place websites will be able to read data from the dmvboardgames.com
    backend through an API. Source code for dmvboardgames.com is
    <a href="https://github.com/gatherspiel/DMVBoardGames">here</a>
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Reasons why a decentralized network of third websites is a good idea</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>It is difficult for a general purpose website to meet the interests of specific hobbies or communities. People
      have a variety of different interests that will be complex to effectively represent on one website. Also, it is
      impossible for the developers of one site to have knowledge about every single community and hobby.</li>
      <li>Smaller websites can have content related to the interests of their audience without affecting how others
      see content they want to see. As an example, <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com">dmvboardgames.com</a>,
      a website promoting in person board games in the DC area has a <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/html/static/designers.html">
      page for local board game designers.</a></li>
      <li> Local community organizers can submit event information to a large aggregator website without being
        dependent on them. If the large website does something similar to Meetup.com and starts charging $300 per year
        to host groups while downgrading their UI, the owners can move to a different aggregator or not use one.</li>
      <li>The ability to connect with <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> websites through
      <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/">ActivityPub.</a></li>
    </ul>

  <h2>More details about issues with Meetup and other websites for third place events</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Issues with other third place websites</summary>
    <p>
      In the past, there were a variety of sites that people could use to promote events in third
      places. Unfortunately many of these sites have declined in quality or prioritize keeping people online.
      The website Meetup.com was a notable exception as it prioritized in person events. However,
      the quality of Meetup has declined, and it is no longer a good option for hosting events.
      <a href="/static/events/meetupProblems.html">See this page for more details.</a>
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
      Other platforms are attempting to compete with Meetup such as Luma and Partiful. However, they follow
      the same VC funded for profit business model used by Meetup, and are on the path to
      <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys">enshittification</a>
      This includes one former competitor Eventbrite, which has been
      <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/bending-spoons-agrees-to-buy-eventbrite-for-500m-to-revive-stalled-brand/">
        purchased by the company Bending Spoons </a>. This is the same company that owns Meetup.com and has been responsible
      for its latest problems.</a>
