  <h1>Decentralized meetup alternative</h1>

  <p>
    Createthirdplaces.com is working on open source software
    for people to find in person events as a way of promoting third places.
  </p>

  Here are the guidelines that will be followed for any changes
  See the <a href="/static/vision.html">vision page </a> for more details.

  <ul>
    <li>Support in person interaction</li>
    <li>All content is human generated</li>
    <li>No personalized recommendations</li>
    <li>Non-commercial</li>
    <li>Decentralization</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Details about the decentralized architecture</h2>

  <p>The general idea behind the decentralized architecture will involve having 2 types of sites. Local websites
  for a specific activities and aggregator websites. Local websites will be independently created and run
  while sharing data through an API. Aggregator websites will read data from multiple local sites and allow users
  to search through multiple sites at the same time. Aggregator websites can also be aggregators for other websites.</p>

  <p>For example, there can be a local websites in DC for chess events and a website for playing resource
  management games such as Catan. A board game aggregator website could then read information from the chess
  website and Catan website, and allow users to search for events related to both activities. The board game
  aggregator website could then have data read by a DC area aggregator website that combines information
  from other types of websites such as DC sporting event website. </p>

  <h3>One way of efficiently implementing a decentralized architecture would be to make sure websites fulfill the following
  guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When a group is created on a local website, the information is saved to a database of events for the website
      with a UUID as the primary key. The events would then be accessible through a public API.</li>
    <li>Aggregator websites save the UUIDs of all groups in their aggregation and include references to the API endpoint
    of the original site location. This information will be available through an API endpoint for other aggregator
    websites.</li>
    <li>When an aggregator website requests information about a specific group, it will retrieve the UUID and local
    website URL from its database. This can then be used to perform a query on the original website through multiple
    aggregation layers without significant performance degradation.</li>
    <li> All aggregator websites will need to register with the websites they are aggregating from. After registering,
      the aggregator will retrieve all the groups from the website they registered with. When a group is
      created or deleted, it will look at the websites that registered as aggregators, and then call an API endpoint for
      the aggregator to make sure it has information about the group.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Challenges that this architecture will address</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Efficiently reading updated data from other websites. If an aggregator website has to check other websites to
        get information and those websites are also aggregators, then it will be important to optimize performance. Also,
        circular dependencies will also need to be handled. </li>
      <li>Handling authentication and user permissions. One possible way to address the complexity would be for people to
        have the ability to join group or modify groups they created through aggregator websites. This would help with
        usability. However, it will add complexity in the short term and could make things too centralized.
      </li>
      <li>Handling issues with too many requests from a location</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    As a starting point, a local website for in person board games in the DC area is
    being worked on at <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/">dmvboardgames.com</a>.
    Other third place websites will be able to read data from the dmvboardgames.com
    backend through an API. Source code for dmvboardgames.com is
    <a href="https://github.com/gatherspiel/DMVBoardGames">here</a>

  <details>
    <summary>Reasons why a decentralized network of third websites is a good idea</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>It is difficult for a general purpose website to meet the interests of specific hobbies or communities. People
      have a variety of different interests that will be complex to effectively represent on one website. Also, it is
      impossible for the developers of one site to have knowledge about every single community and hobby.</li>
      <li>Smaller websites can have content related to the interests of their audience without affecting how others
      see content they want to see. As an example, <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com">dmvboardgames.com</a>,
      a website promoting in person board games in the DC area has a <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/html/static/designers.html">
      page for local board game designers.</a></li>
      <li> Local community organizers can submit event information to a large aggregator website without being
        dependent on them. If the large website does something similar to Meetup.com and starts charging $300 per year
        to host groups while downgrading their UI, the owners can move to a different aggregator or not use one.</li>
      <li>The ability to connect with <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> websites through
      <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/">ActivityPub.</a></li>
    </ul>

  <h2>More details about issues with Meetup and other websites for third place events</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Issues with other third place websites</summary>
    <p>
      In the past, there were a variety of sites that people could use to promote events in third
      places. Unfortunately many of these sites have declined in quality or prioritize keeping people online.
      The website Meetup.com was a notable exception as it prioritized in person events. However,
      the quality of Meetup has declined, and it is no longer a good option for hosting events.

      Other platforms are attempting to compete with Meetup such as Luma and Partiful. However, they follow
      the same VC funded for profit business model used by Meetup, and are on the path to

      This includes one former competitor Eventbrite, which has been

      for its latest problems.</a>
