  <h1>Decentralized meetup alternative</h1>

  <p>
    Createthirdplaces.com is also working on open source software
    for people to find in person events in third places. It will have
    similar functionality to Meetup.com without the for-profit monetization or online
    communication features, and it will be
    decentralized.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, there were a variety of sites that people could use to promote events in third
    places. Unfortunately many of these sites have declined in quality or prioritize keeping people online.
    The website Meetup.com was a notable exception as it prioritized in person events. However,
    the quality of Meetup has declined, and it is no longer a good option for hosting events.

    Other platforms are attempting to compete with Meetup such as Luma and Partiful. However, they follow
    the same VC funded for profit business model used by Meetup, and are on the path to
    <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys">enshittification</a>
    This includes one former competitor Eventbrite, which has been
    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/bending-spoons-agrees-to-buy-eventbrite-for-500m-to-revive-stalled-brand/">
      purchased by the company Bending Spoons </a>. This is the same company that owns Meetup.com and has been responsible
    for its latest problems.

  <p>Createthirdplaces.com is looking for people to create websites specifically for a type
  of activity or a one area. It will be difficult for a general purpose website
  to meet the needs of specific interests or communities.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    As a starting point, a local website for in person board games in the DC area
    has been created at <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/">dmvboardgames.com</a>.
    Other third place websites will be able to read data from the dmvboardgames.com
    backend through an API. Source code for dmvboardgames.com is
    <a href="https://github.com/gatherspiel/DMVBoardGames">here</a>
