          <h1>Toaster trouble </h1>

          <h2>Overview of game.</h2>

          <p>You are trying to escape a planet occupied by evil space toasters.
          Toasters have also developed the ability to disguise themselves as humans
          and will try to sabotage your escape. Play bread to neutralize
          the toasters and identify the toasters.</p>

          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Select and shuffle role cards based on the number of players.</li>
            <ol>
              <li>2 players: 1 toaster card and 2 human cards. </li>
              <li>3 players: 1 toaster card and 3 human cards. </li>
              <li>4 players: 1 toaster card and 4 human cards. </li>
              <li>5 players: 2 toaster cards and 4 human cards. </li>
              <li>6 players: 2 toaster cards and 5 human cards. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Shuffle the encounter tokens and place face down on each map space.</li>
            <li>Shuffle the human tokens and place them face down on the map, one space away from
            any other human tokens.</li>
            <li>Shuffle the ship tokens face down and place one token on each map space on one end of the board.</li>
            <li>Set each player to 3 hit points.</li>
            <li>Each player draw 5 bread cards.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Winning the game</h2>
          <p>Human players win if they reach a working ship on the other end
          of the map. Toaster players win if one player runs out of hit points. </p>

          <h2>Playing a round.</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Each player moves up to 3 spaces</li>
            <li>Players reveal encounter tokens and resolve the effect. Encounter tokens will either be drawing bread cards,
            fighting toasters, or encountering with someone that looks like a human. </li>
            <li>The first player to enter a space may flip over the human token. Some of the tokens will be toasters,
            which will immediately start a combat encounter. If aa human icon is revealed, the player who revealed the token
            draws a bread card.</li>
            <li>If the player reaches a ship token, they secretly look at the ship token and can share information about
            the ship. Some of the ships will be damaged and cannot be used to escape.</li>
            <li>If a human or revealed toaster is on the same space at the end of a movement phase, combat immediately
             happens with a player chosen by the toaster. Each player reveals and discards one bread card. The player with the
             highest bread card wins, and the human player wins any ties. If the toaster player wins, the human player loses
             1 hit point. if the human players wins, the toaster discards one bread card. If a player has no bread cards,
             their combat strength is 0.</li>
          </ol>


          <h2>Resolving combat from encounter or human tokens.</h2>

           <ol>
            <li>Starting with the first player in a space, each player plays any number of bread cards face down.</li>
            <li>Draw two cards from the bread deck and shuffle the played cards.</li>
            <li>To resolve combat, reveal all the bread cards. Bread cards of the same type as the encounter give positive
              strength, and other type of bread cards give negative strength. If the total played strength is equal to or greater
               than the mission strength, the players survive the encounter without damage. Otherwise, one player in the mission
               loses a hit point.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Playing as a toaster</h2>

          <p>Toaster players start the game and take turns similar to human players.
          At any time during the game during their turn, a toaster may reveal themselves
          and start combat against another player. </p>

          <h2>Sharing bread</p>

          <p>When you are next to another player, you may give bread cards to them.
          There is no limit to the number of bread cards that can be traded or a
          hand limit </p>
