      <h1>Vision</h1>

      <p>
        <b>
          The goal of Create Third Places is to promote interest in accessible public spaces. To
          promote this goal, these guidelines will be followed for any changes.
        </b>
      </p>

      <h2>Support in person interaction</h2>

      <p>
        All content will support the goal of encouraging people to
        interact in person. For example, a feature that makes it easier for
        people to find in person events would be a good fit for the website.
        Changes to improve usability or readability of the website also
        support this goal. Forums, comments, or any other form of online
        messaging will not be supported by Create Third Places. People should be
        encouraged to meet and exchange contact information in person before
        communicating online.
      </p>

      <h2>All content is human generated</h2>

      <p>
        Create Third Places will be developed and maintained by humans without
        the use of automated tools such as bots or generative AI. Users will
        also not be allowed to use automated tools to interact with the
        website.
      </p>

      <h2>No personalized recommendations</h2>

      <p>
        Create Third Places  will not provide personalized recommendations. Users
        are encouraged to get recommendations through connecting with others
        in person at events and considering their interests When users see events or other content, it should
        be because they made a decision to view that content.
      </p>

      <h2>No Commercial Monetization</h2>

      <p>
        Create Third Places will not be a profit making entity, and website code is
        <a href="https://github.com/orgs/createthirdplaces/repositories">open source. </a>
        Create Third Places  will prioritize necessary fundraising to pay for expenses through
        donations and selling products that can be used to promote third places such as board games.
      </p>

      <h2>Promote Decentralization</h2>

      <p>
        People should be empowered to take independent actions to promote third places in their own
        community. Create Third Places  aims to support these people with advice and examples of
        ways that third places can be promoted. There are a variety of ways that third places
        can be promoted based on a person's interests and their community.
