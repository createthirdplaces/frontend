    <h1>Create Third Places tech strategy</h1>

    <p>The goal of Create Third Places is to promote accessible offline public spaces called third places. Tech will be
      used as a way to support this goal.</p>


    <h2>Learning</h2>

    <p>When working on Create Third Places, long-term learning is important. While shortcuts
      can improve short term productivity, they are likely to be detrimental to long term learning.</p>

    <p>People working on Create Third Places should also be developing skills for writing good software, and not
      just focus on getting things done. Good software is designed well from a technical perspective while
      provides a good user experience. This also means avoiding writing software that is not relevant to a user.
      Unnecessary software takes time to write and maintain.</p>

    <p>While minimizing dependencies is important, there should be a limit to the amount of time spent on trying
      to replace dependencies with handwritten code. For example, programming the entire backend for an event
      hosting website in assembly would be useful for learning how a computer works and how memory is managed. However,
      programming in assembly language would be time-consuming and add a significant amount of complexity.
      Maintenance would also be a challenge because of the amount of assembly code that needs to be written. </p>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <p>
      New features should support the goal of promoting accessible offline third places. While features such as
      discussion boards and private messaging are useful, they will not be supported by Create Third Places because
      they do not directly support the goal of encouraging people to meet in a third place. People should be encouraged
      to meet new people in third places and then share contact information there if they want to communicate
      online.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another example of a feature that will not be included is the ability to rate third places. Ratings
      take up room in the UI and be a distraction for some people. People are also unlikely to
      take time to rate every third place they visit, and there are already existing sites where people rate third
      places.
      For example, on December 23rd, 2025 there were <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/dupont-circle-washington">
        130 Yelp ratings for Dupont Circle in Washington DC</a>, which is far less than the
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3BG5VUad82ZXsLi28">1022 ratings on Google Maps.</a> Google Maps reviews for
      DuPont Circle started being added more than 5 years ago, which would translate to 0 or 1 review posted
      on an average day and most people do not submit Google Maps ratings.
      DuPont Circle is an area of DC that receives a high amount of foot traffic, which averages
      to far more than 1 person per day.
    </p>

    <p>
      While ratings can also be a way for people to communicate preferences for a third place, it can also lead to
      people rating a third place without having been there. Create Third Places encourages people to talk with people
      they met in person to get and share feedback on third places.
    </p>

    <p>
      Too many features will make Create Third Places a less effective resource for people. A large number of features
      will make it harder to find core features such as event filtering. Also, additional features that add interactivity
      will increase the tine necessary to maintain and test the codebase.
    </p>

    <p>
      One possibility for adding new features is a plugin system for users to customize their experience. These plugins
      would use JavaScript and be loaded when a user logs in. Also, the plugins would be integrated with the site without
      using any external JavaScript dependencies. It will be easier to write plugins when they don’t have to consider
      rendering patterns specific to a dependency such as React. Also, anyone who wants to create a plugin and knows
      JavaScript will be able to do so without needing to know how a specific external dependency works.
    </p>

    <p> However, there are some challenges to consider with plugin support. One challenge is that plugins could cause
      security issues through malicious scripts. To address this, all plugins should go through a review process before
      people can use them, or the scripts need to be blocked from making API calls. Also, the complexity of maintaining
      support for custom scripts and plugins needs to be considered.
    </p>

    <p>
      A plugin system would also need to be designed in a way that doesn't make decentralization harder. If developers
      are building plugins, there could be too much centralization because the plugins are dependent on
      Create Third Places . Create Third Places will also encourage people to create their own third place websites to provide
      customized functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>User experience</h2>

    <p>User experience is very important  In addition to regularly asking users for feedback, the following metrics
      are prioritized to make sure createthirdplaces.com provides a good user experience. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All user actions generate a visual response within 100 milliseconds.</li>
      <li>If a user action is going to take more than 100 milliseconds to resolve, then a loading indicator should be shown. </li>
      <li>User actions should not take more than 100 milliseconds to show a result when no API call is necessary. </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Notes on key technical principles</h2>

    <h3>Minimize tech debt</h3>
    <p>Minimizing tech debt will have the following main benefits</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Lower costs.</b> Tech debt will increase the costs of createthirdplaces.com, and increase
          the need for donations and paid features. This could cause a need to compromise on values to raise the necessary
          money. Higher costs are likely to cause a need for manipulative tactics that make it harder for people to
          think for themselves. People should use the site because they want to, and not because they have been manipulated
          into using the site.
        </li>
        <li><b>Addressing user feedback more quickly.</b>Less tech debt means the code is less complex, which
          translates to a need to spend less time to make changes. People will be using createthirdplaces.com by choice and
          the website will not have a large advertising budget. As a result, information
          about the website will likely spread more through word of mouth, and it will be important to provide a good
          user experience. This includes quickly addressing bugs that users report.
        </li>      </ul>

      <b>Some things that should be done to reduce tech debt.</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Prioritize readability</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Code should be straightforward to make sure developers can quickly understand it.
              Readable code will lead to a reduced risk of developers accidentally making a change that adds a bug or
              one that adds complexity. Trying to look at complex the code might give the impression that it does
              one thing when reality is that it does something else.
            <br>
            <br>
            Poor readability could also cause developers to become frustrated. As createthirdplaces.com is a website
            that encourages community, it's important to make sure stress levels aren't high. Less stress will help
            people enjoy their personal lives and make it easier to build community.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    <li>
      <b>Minimize dependencies</b>
      <ul>
        <li>More dependencies adds more complexity and can make dependency management significantly harder.</li>
        <li>More dependencies will increase load time, which can be a significant issue on the frontend.</li>
        <li>
          Learning how to use a dependency or choosing a dependency for a specific task will take time. Also, people
          might recommend different solutions for the use case
          a dependency is going to address. One example is when looking for recommendations for third party tools to
          manage UI state for a frontend mae with React. There are a variety of tools recommended including MobX,
          Redux Toolkit, and Zustand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another issue with too many dependencies is breaking changes with an upgrade or recommendation to move to a new
          pattern. While staying with an older version of a library is possible, it can cause challenges.
          For example, class components were recommended for use in React in older versions. Later, functional components
          were recommended, while documentation for class components remained. This fragmentation increases the difficutly
          of getting help.
        </li>
        <li>A dependency may have specific ways of providing functionality that can conflict with outside patterns
          being applied.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Take time upfront to build features with minimal tech debt </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This ensures that there is a strong foundation that can effectively handle changes. New features are
          probably not going to remain static as they will need to be updated to add enhancements or fix bugs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Prioritize documentation </b>
      <ul>
        Website documentation should be minimized while containing necessary information. Documentation needs to be
        updated to be considered changes, which takes time. Not updating
        documentation means that documentation can be a distraction because it contains outdated information that
        seems relevant. In the case where documentation is clearly outdated, developers will spend
        time looking through the documentation to realize it is out of date.
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Use a multi page application(MPA) architecture instead of a Single page application(SPA) </b>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be multiple pages, some of which are interactive. If JavaScript on a page becomes too
          complicated, the page will be split.</li>
        <li>
          Using a SPA can make the user experience slightly better due to faster loading speed after the initial
          page load. However, creating a high quality SPA will add a significant amount of complexity and time needed
          to maintain  code. Complexity  will come from the code necessary to implement SPA functionality in addition to the fact that complexity
          on one area of the website is less likely to be isolated.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Decouple the backend from the frontend</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The backend should be decoupled from the frontend. While there are many powerful frameworks which rely on
          coupling the frontend and the backend, and there could be performance or speed benefits from the coupling,
          it is best to avoid the coupling. A decoupled backend and frontend will help with complexity isolation,
          which will become increasingly important as createthirdplaces.com code becomes more complex.
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          A large amount of createthirdplaces.com is static content that can be displayed with CSS, HTML, and
          JavaScript. This static content does not need the complexity of a backend.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a backend decoupled from the frontend will also help with creating a decentralized network
          of third place websites with event information. If event information for a third place website
          is available through an API, then an aggregator website can then use that information to show
          information about a larger variety of events.
          <a href="https://github.com/gatherspiel/backend">Here </a> is an
          example of a backend service for events with an API to access information.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>

    <h3>Prioritize site reliability</h3>

    <p>It is important for createthirdplaces.com and any other third place websites to prioritize reliability. This means
    that backend services should not be complex and run with minimal to no downtime. One sign
      of good software is that it can stay running for long periods of time without downtime. </p>
    <p>A website that is likely to crash or have significant reliability issues requires on-call support to minimize
    downtime. Being on-call means that someone could have their personal life interrupted by an urgent need to fix
    an issue. It also interferes with community building if a person hosting an event has to also be on-call.
    createthirdplaces.com should aim to be up 24/7, including times when developers working on the site aren't
    immediately available.</p>


    <h2>Notes on technologies that will be used</h2>

    <p>When picking technologies, the following criteria should be prioritized in additional to the ones
    listed above</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Minimize dependencies on 3rd party cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.</li>
      <li>Support developing using Linux.</li>
      <li>Use open source technology.</li>
      <li>Support <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/">ActivityPub.</a></li>
      <li>Minimize dependencies on third party frameworks and libraries.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>createthirdplaces.com code will use vanilla JavaScript on the frontend with
      the <a href="/static/tech/placesjs.html">places.js custom framework</a></p>

    <details>
      <summary>An evaluation of using React and Node.js</summary>

      <p>
        <b>Some advantages of using React and Node.js</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Familiarity with React is likely to speed up development. There are a variety of web development tools that
          exist with different strengths and weaknesses. However, many developers are familiar with React and Node.js,
          and many websites have been successfully created with React.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using tools that developers are less likely to be familiar with such as Kotlin and Vue.js will
            add short term challenges. Developers will probably have to take time to learn them, which will slow them
          down for a while. Code quality will probably also become worse in the short term. </li>
        <li>
          Learning about an unfamiliar tool might end up being a waste of time if it is not useful for
          createthirdplaces.com
        </li>
        <li>
          The fact that React is widely used will make it easier to find other developers to help work on the website.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Challenges with using React</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>React guides encourage too many dependencies</b>. Dependencies often
          have other dependencies that may not be compatible with each other or have breaking changes.
          Dependencies should also not be added without a clear understanding of the benefits and drawbacks. They can be
          added later once developers have enough understanding of them. For example, server side rendering in Next.js
          does provide performance benefits on the initial website load. However, the magnitude of the performance
          benefit is dependent on the content being presented, and the drawbacks of additional complexity with Next.js
          should be considered.
          <br>
          <br>
          Due to the large number of dependencies that a React codebase ends up including, upgrading to the
          latest version of React may not be realistic possibility. Even if blockers with incompatible dependencies
          can be resolved, there might be challenges with updating dependencies to handle breaking changes that would
          take a very long time to handle.
          <br>
          <br>
          For example, a codebase could be created using React 19 and a dependency on a custom library to provide
          reusable React components. When the next version of React is released, upgrading can be a challenge
          if the custom component library stays with React 19. It might end up being necessary to spend time
          migrating to a different component library in order to upgrade React
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Documentation is inconsistent due to updates made to React.</b> While the official documentation
          for React has remained up-to-date, many developers have published their own documentation which has become
          outdated. They might also come across as misleading because
          they are pushing for solutions that appear to make sense, although they are not compatible with the
          version of React that is being used. that do not make sense with the version of React that is being used.
          <br>
          <br>

          For example, here are 3 possible ways to manage UI state using React.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useState">useState</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext">useContext</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer">useReducer</a></li>
          </ul>
          There are also a variety of state management libraries that can be used, and sometimes they can be
          combined such as using <a href="https://tanstack.com/query/latest">TanStack Query</a> and
          <a href="https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction">Zustand.</a> If
          <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started">Redux Toolkit</a> is used, then
          there is a TanStack Query equivalent called <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview">
          RTK query</a> that can be used.
          <br>
          <br>
          While useContext isn't a recommended way to manage complex state, it is possible to manage complex state
          with useContext. Starting off with the useContext hook to store state in a React context will work for a
          simple application, and the problems with useContext will probably reveal themselves in the form of
          slow UI rendering and rendering logic that is hard to follow. At this point, the application will be
          complex, and improving the state management code will be complex.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Documentation sometimes encourages solutions that may not make sense for
            a use case</b>. For example, many articles
          found in December 2024 were suggesting using Server Side React with a tool such as Next.js. At the time, it
          seemed that Next.js would add a significant amount of complexity and performance overhead without benefits.
          When searching the official React documentation in late 2025, it contained recommendations to get started
          with React by using Next.js.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reasons why vanilla JavaScript should be used</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Complexity of pages may not justify using React.</li>
        <li>State can be managed in vanilla JavaScript such as by using the technique listed below
          <ul>
            <li>
              A custom JS file can be used to save a state object and return it. While the approach of using a custom
              JS file is more complex, there is the advantage of having one less dependency.
            </li>
            <li>The state object can have callback lists for each getter for components to subscribe to.</li>
            <li>Components can generate html and event listeners that subscribe to store and re-render as necessary.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API">Observer API</a>
              can be used to subscribe to component visibility
            </li>
            <li>All API calls save data to a global state.</li>
            <li>When rendering, each component will create class id tags that will be linked to state.</li>
            <li>Active visible components will be stored in a tree structure.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Less dependence on Internet to look up documentation</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Developers will spend less time on the Internet, which helps with focus.
              Many websites that answer technical questions about
              frameworks have other distractions even though they are also giving useful information. Also, websites
              have inaccurate or misleading information that needs to be parsed through. The usefulness of
            online documentation has also declined as more people are creating documentation with the help of generative
              AI.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>UI code does not have to rely on framework behavior that is hard to notice or understand. As a result
          vanilla JavaScript can lead to fewer rendering bugs and a UI that is more responsive.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Fewer challenges with patterns from outside a dependency being used due to a misunderstanding of the
          dependency.</b> For example, when using React, patterns from other tools will often be applied to React that do
          not make sense in React. One example is conditionally calling a hook within a React 16 functional component
          using an if statement, and this method of calling a hook was not supported in React 16.
          <br>
          <br>
          If someone is not aware of how a certain aspect of a framework works, there might be a challenge such as
          correctly managing state in React without a significant performance overhead.
          One example is making the mistake of managing complex React state in a React context when the state is changing
          frequently.  The issue is that every component subscribed to the context will update when one part of the
          context is updated, even if the change was not relevant to the UI component. This can cause performance
          slowdowns that are challenging to understand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Improved rendering speed.</b> UI loading speed is very important for a good user experience. An interface
          that loads quickly and is responsive is one that people want to use. A framework does add some amount of load
          time, especially if it comes with other dependencies. For example, React is often combined with a state
          management library.
        </li>
        <li><b>Sometimes, the added difficulty of implementing UI components in vanilla could be a good thing.</b> If UI
          changes are quicker to implement, that incentivizes more UI changes to be done. Create Third Places should
          only focus on changes that are essential for people to find or host in person events. Focusing too much
          on website features is a mistake.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

      <h3>Notes about other technologies</h3>

        <li>
          <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>: New Javascript runtime made by the creator of Node.js
        </li>

          <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>
          <ul>
            <li>Kubernetes could be used to make a website cloud platform agnostic. </li>
            <li>Other developers could then create forks of the website for their own location or activity specific
              website. Kubernetes could simplify the process that other developers will have to follow to work on the

      <h3>Backend alternatives to Node.js with TypeScript</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>:
          Static typing and unit testing support with JUnit and Mockito are helpful. However, it is harder
        to get a basic API running.</li>
        <li>Using Node.js without TypeScript
          While TypeScript type checking is helpful, there are some challenges with using TypeScript.
          <ul>
            <li>An extra step in the build process.</li>
            <li>Typescript type checking can cause issues with certain versions of npm packages if
              package and types are not defined.</li>
            <li>Writing unit tests could be more challenging when trying to use mock objects because of type definitions.
              For example, one common tool used for Node.js automated testing is Jest, which does support mocks.
              However, Jest can be harder to use and more error prone compared to mocking in Java with Mockito mocks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>
            <ul>
              <li>PHP could be a useful way of rendering web pages on the server. The process for SSR with a UI library
                appears to be less complex than using a JS framework such as Next.js based on
                <a href=" https://inertiajs.com/client-side-setup">this example</a>. If a JS library is not necessary,
                it is straightforward to just add a PHP page on the server.
               </li>
              <li>PHP appears to have more mature tooling compared to Node.js because it has been around for more time.</li>
              <li> Node.js has a limited selection of built-in libraries compared to PHP. For example,
                a database library has to be installed to connect to a database in Node.js, while PHP already has one.
                Writing a custom database library would be a time-consuming process. The number of dependencies will
                make the challenge of managing dependencies between libraries harder in Node.JS</li>

    <h2>Lessons learned form initial development by Bharat Ponnaluri</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Pivot away from a tool that does not seem to be working.</li>
      <li>When planning how long a feature will take, account for the chance that you may be trying to use a tool that
        does not address the use case. </li>
      <li>Don’t spend too much time trying to pick the perfect set of tools before trying to write code. Sometimes,
        seeing how a tool works when attempting to use it for a feature is the best way of knowing if it works or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don’t rush to get something working, and make sure you are building off a good foundation.

      <h4><a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a> evaluation</h4>

      <p>
        I found out that the creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl created a new JavaScript runtime called Deno.js. I initially
        thought it was an improvement over Node.js due to improved package management and built-in TypeScript support.
        Also, I thought that the fact that Deno.js was new would be a good opportunity for Dahl and other Deno.js
        developers to improve upon some challenges with Node.js I noticed such as intermittent build failures and
        confusing error stack traces.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in December 2024, I ran into challenges when attempting to deploy dmvboardgames.com with Deno and React.
        Troubleshooting errors was difficult because documentation was limited. The latest error I ran into was a build
        error when attempting to use the React useState hook. Upon investigation, I found out that the error was related
        to how Deno imported the React dependency, and I did not find any documentation on a workaround.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I could’ve spent time trying to troubleshoot the issue with the useState hook, I decided that it was not
        worthwhile. Troubleshooting the issue with the useState hook was going to take an uncertain amount of time if I
        was able to resolve the issue. I also thought it was possible that I was going to spend a large amount of time trying
        to resolve the issue and then running into a blocker that would’ve required solving the issue by either not
        using React or Deno.js.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, the limited documentation and the fact that I was running into an issue with the useState hook made me
        concerned about the risk of running into other challenges. React was the most popular library for building
        new interactive web applications in 2024, and useState was often used in React. If Deno.js was not able to have
        a working script or documentation for a common use case, I was concerned about its ability to support less
        common use cases.
      </p>

      <h4>Deployment pipeline</h4>

      <p>
        While it is possible to deploy by building the site manually and then copying and pasting on the server, I
        decided to build an automated pipeline for deployment. Although there was a significant amount of upfront time
        investment required to automatically deploy dmvboardgames.com, I thought it was worth the time to deploy
        dmvboardgames.com more quickly in the future. Also, I was able to use what I had learned and quickly create a
        similar setup for automatically deploying createthirdplaces.com
      </p>

      <p>
        Having to manually build and then copy and paste to the server would have been quicker in the short term.
        However, it would have been very time-consuming in the long term. I decided to set up a test build for
        dmvboardgames.com using the main branch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I set up an automated production deployment pipeline on DigitalOcean. Every time an update was made to the
        prod branch, a deployment would happen and the updates would go live. The idea behind having a separate prod
        branch was that the changes would be verified on the main branch, and then the changes would be merged to the
        prod branch. From past experience, I  learned that merging code to a prod branch that has only been tested
        locally is risky, even with automated tests.  Also, this testing setup was designed as a way for changes to be
        verified by another person without them needing to manually download and run a test version of the website.
