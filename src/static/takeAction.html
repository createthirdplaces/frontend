    <h1>Take Action</h1>
    <q>Real change starts locally. You make it possible.</q>(<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/">Strong Towns</a>)

    <p>Third places are created by people taking initiative to support third places. Think about something you can do
    this week. Actions do not have to be big and taking a few minutes per day helps. Here are some recommendations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Walk through a public park and saying hi to a stranger who looks towards you with a friendly smile.</li>
      <li>Briefly talk with a stranger in a public space if they indicate an openness to conversation.</li>
      <li>Show up to a public event being hosted at a community center.</li>
      <li>Volunteer at your local public library.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Taking time to show other people how great third places can be is also helpful. Multiple people
    promoting a third place is more effective than one person promoting it.</p>

      for a community-based approach towards building cities.
