  <h1>Decentralized meetup alternative</h1>

  <p>
    Createthirdplaces.com is also working on open source software
    for people to find in person events in third places. It will have
    similar functionality to Meetup.com without the for-profit monetization or online
    communication features, and it will be
    decentralized.
  </p>

  </br>
  <p>Createthirdplaces.com is looking for people to create websites specifically for a type
  of activity or a one area. It will be difficult for a general purpose website
  to meet the needs of specific interests or communities.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    As a starting point, a local website for in person board games in the DC area
    has been created at <a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/">dmvboardgames.com</a>.
    Other third place websites will be able to read data from the dmvboardgames.com
    backend through an API. Source code for dmvboardgames.com is
    <a href="https://github.com/gatherspiel/DMVBoardGames">here</a>
