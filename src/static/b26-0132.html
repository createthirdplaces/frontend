  <h1>Letter by Bharat Ponnaluri in support of B26-0132 - Expanding Community Access to
    Safe and Clean Recreational Space Act of 2025</h1>
  <p>B26-0132 is proposed legislation in DC that will expand community access to schools on evening and weekend hours
  for recreational purposes. <a href="https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Legislation/B26-0132">Here</a>
    is the full text of the bill
  </p>

  <p>I  am a resident of DC living in Dupont Circle. I support B26-0132 in order to expand access to community
    meeting space. I run a public community board game group that is looking for meeting space, and I’m a member of
    Strong Towns DMV.</p>

  <p> Over the past 10 years, I have noticed a significant decline in the availability of accessible community gathering
    spaces in DC, and the government should step in. Back in 2015, many of the community gathering spaces were in bars
    and restaurants that are no longer options. Many places have closed, shortened their hours, or raised food prices.
    While many new restaurants and bars have opened up, the ones with space typically have high food prices that limit
    accessibility. </p>

  <p>The hardest part of organizing community events is finding accessible space in regards to cost, opening hours,
    and room size. Other groups I’ve talked to have had similar challenges, including one I was a part of that moved
    it’s regular location 4 times within the span of a year, in addition to various temporary locations that didn’t
    work. </p>

  <p>Two spaces I remember are the Panera on the southern side of DuPont Circle and the Noodles and Company on 17th
    Street near Farragut Square. They had a variety of low-cost food items so that the cost of food was not a major
    accessibility barrier. Unfortunately, both these places closed and turned into vacant commercial lots.</p>

  I think the legislation should be passed for the following benefits.

  <ul>
    <li>Incremental neighborhood improvements are best done by residents working together.  More community spaces
      would give more opportunities for neighbors to connect with each other, and form friendships that will translate
      into working on neighborhood improvements.</li>
    <li>Public health would improve as the community spaces include sports facilities where people can exercise.</li>
    <li>Expanded access to local recreational spaces would make people more connected with their communities and
      neighbors. In DC, travelling to a local space would likely involve walking and possibly public transit. This
      allows them to get a better view of their community and connect with other locals. At these community spaces,
      people would form in person connections with their community.</li>
  </ul>
